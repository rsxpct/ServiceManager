# ServiceManager
I call this, 'Service Manager'. It auto-creates Object-Orientated Objects for you and lets you just start working on the functions!

Think of it as creating a mini-module script. This is to help newer developers get into Object Orientated Programming without the hassle of making new modules etc.

It's insanely lightweight with limited features as of now, I'll be adding support for broader features soon.

If you have features you request to be added, Either DM me or Add it yourself (And dm so I can add it for others.)

Only has support for functions and variables right now.
